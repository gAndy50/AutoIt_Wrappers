These are a collection of wrappers for the AutoIt programming language. Note this uses version 3 of AutoIt. These are mainly a collection of
wrappers for multimedia libraries such as SDL and GFLW. 

# EXAMPLE: Basic usage of how to use the SDL2 wrapper.  
```AutoIt
#include <SDL2.au3>

Local $w = 640, $h = 480

Local $x = SDL_Init($SDL_INIT_VIDEO)

If $x = -1 Then
  MsgBox(1,"Error","Could not init SDL!")
EndIf

Local $win = SDL_CreateWindow("MyWin - Closes after 3 seconds",$SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,$SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,$w,$h,$SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN)

if $win = -1 Then
   MsgBox(1,"Error","Could not make window")
EndIf

SDL_Delay(3000)

SDL_DestroyWindow($win)

SDL_Quit()
```

# SIGIL EXAMPLE:
```AutoIt
#include <Sigil.au3>

Local $w = 640, $h = 480
Local $true = 1, $false = 0

slWindow($w,$h,"Sigil Window",$false)
